Visual Studio Code Terminal: Troubleshooting Conda Environment Activation
*************************************************************************

When working with Python, managing environments is crucial to ensure that our project dependencies are isolated and reproducible. 
Anaconda, with its Conda package manager, is a popular choice among data scientists for this purpose. 
However, a common issue that many encounter is the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal not activating the Conda environment.

When we create a new Conda environment and open a new terminal in VSCode, we might expect the terminal to automatically activate the Conda environment. 
However, this doesn’t always happen. Instead, we might find that the base environment is activated, or no environment is activated at all. 
This can lead to confusion and potential issues when running our Python scripts.

Ensuring VSCode Recognizes Conda
--------------------------------
The first step in resolving this issue is to ensure that VSCode recognizes Conda. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open VSCode and go to the settings (File > Preferences > Settings or use the shortcut Ctrl+,).
2. Search for Python:Conda Path.
3. In the input box, enter the path to your conda executable file. This is typically located in the bin directory of our Anaconda installation.
												    -------------------------------------------

For finding bin directory of our Anaconda installation follow these steps :
1. Open Anaconda Prompt by searching in windows

2. type -> where conda 
                this will give path where anaconda is installed

3. type -> where python
		this will give path to python interpreter
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting the Python Interpreter
-------------------------------
The next step is to set the Python interpreter for our workspace. 
This tells VSCode which Python environment to use when running our scripts. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
2. Type Python: Select Interpreter and select it.
3. From the list, select the Conda environment we want to use. or we can Add Path to interpreter from step 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuring the Terminal to Activate the Conda Environment
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally, we need to configure the terminal to automatically activate the Conda environment when it starts. Here’s how:

1. Go back to the settings (Ctrl+,).
2. Search for Python:Terminal:Activate Environment.
3. Make sure this setting is checked.

*Configure VSCode Integrated Terminal
------------------------------------
VSCode uses the integrated terminal for executing commands. 
If the terminal doesn’t recognize the ‘conda’ command, it’s likely because the Conda path isn’t configured correctly in VSCode.

To fix this, we need to update the VSCode settings. 
Open VSCode, go to ‘File’ > ‘Preferences’ > ‘Settings’. Search for ‘terminal.integrated.shellArgs’ and add the path to our Conda installation.

*From drop down select the command prompt or cmd
